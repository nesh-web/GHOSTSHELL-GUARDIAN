  "intent": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attempt",
  "mitre_technique": "T1059.007",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "reasoning": "While the payload is a benign proof-of-concept string often used for testing, the source IP (172.16.254.9) is internal (RFC 1918). This indicates potential unauthorized internal scanning, a compromised host, or an unannounced penetration test.",
  "recommended_action": "Verify if the source IP belongs to an authorized vulnerability scanner or security tester. If unauthorized, isolate the source host, inspect user activity logs for the timeframe, and check web server logs to determine if the payload was executed."
